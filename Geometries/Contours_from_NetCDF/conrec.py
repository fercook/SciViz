Usage: \n
conrec(datamatrix, Xpositions, Ypositions, Levels, ["JSON"]) \n
Returns a list of lists, one collection of lists for each level in Levels: \n
[ [ [ [x1,y1],[x2,y2],... ], [ [x1,y1],[x2,y2],... ], ... ],  (list of curves for Levels[0] )
  [ [ [x1,y1],[x2,y2],... ], [ [x1,y1],[x2,y2],... ], ... ],  (list of curves for Levels[1] )
  ....
]

If "JSON" is included as an option, it returns the list of paths and levels converted to JSON format.
